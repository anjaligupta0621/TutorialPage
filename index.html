    <p>Hi All, let's start with what HTML is.</p>
    <P>HTML is Hyper Text Markup Language and it provides a skeleton to any website. All the websites
        that we see in our browsers are written in HTML.
    </P>
    <p>HTML contains tags which specify which line is of which type. These tags are enclosed in '<>'. 
    </p>
